 			- With same board  
 				- Relevant board should be highlighted in both tables and 'vertical' radio button pressed in serverGUI..
 					- No previous connection: resulting in appearance of connection in client window 
 					- Previous connection: resulting in overwriting previous connection in client window 
 		- Horizontal connection

 ==============================

1) Start ServerGUI. Default opening behavior is the opening of the GUI window, with empty board lists and no radio button selected.
   A server should be started at the default port. 
        
2) Connect boards to the server and update boardlists. 
    a)  Connect the board corresponding to file 'boards/default.pb' to the server at default port. The Default 
    	name should now be present in both lists of boards.  
    b)  Connect the board corresponding to file 'boards/flippers.pb' to the server at default port. The Flippers
    	name should now be present in both lists of boards, after Default. 
        
3) Connect board walls for the first time. 
    a)  Select 'horizontal' for connection, Default for Board 1 and Flippers for Board 2, and click connect. 
    	The connections should now be present in the client windows. 
    b)  Select 'vertical' for connection, Default for Board 1 and Flippers for Board 2, and click connect. 
    	The connections should now be present in the client windows.  
    
4) Overwrite existing wall connections. 
    a)  Select 'horizontal' for connection, Default for Board 1 and Default for Board 2, and click connect. 
    	The original horizontal connection between Default and Flippers should disappear, and both of Default's
    	side walls should be connected to each other. 
    b)  Select 'vertical' for connection, Flippers for Board 1 and Flippers for Board 2, and click connect. 
    	The original vertical connection between Default and Flippers should disappear, and Flippers'
    	top and bottom walls should be connected to each other.
